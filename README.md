# auto_routing_eg

# flutter_auto_route_example

A Simple example of Auto_Route flutter package. The auto_route package I use is version 2.2.0 and use the same for output and I will update latest version when done.  

To build the auto_route_generator file once, run the following command.
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   
To build the auto_route_generator file continuously, run the following command.
   flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
   
Note:--  Whenever you make changes in route.dart file, Restart the app (sometimes reload won't have effect).
